## 🧑‍💻 User Guide  

1. **Input Features**: Use sliders and dropdowns to input wine properties like acidity, pH, alcohol, etc.  
2. **Predict Quality**: Click the **Predict** button to see the wine's quality rating.  
3. **Explore Insights**: Check the heatmap to visualize correlations among features.

## 🤔 How Does It Work?  

This app uses a **Random Forest Classifier**, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to predict wine quality. Here's the process:  
1. Data preprocessing: Removing outliers and splitting into training/testing sets.  
2. Training the model: Using `RandomForestClassifier` from Scikit-learn.  
3. Real-time prediction: User input is fed to the model to predict the wine quality.
